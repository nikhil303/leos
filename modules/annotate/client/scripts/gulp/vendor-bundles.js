  // List of modules to exclude from parsing for require() statements.
  //
  // Modules may be excluded from parsing for two reasons:
  //
  // 1. The module is large (eg. jQuery) and contains no require statements,
  //    so skipping parsing speeds up the build process.
  // 2. The module is itself a compiled Browserify bundle containing
  //    internal require() statements, which should not be processed
  //    when including the bundle in another project.
