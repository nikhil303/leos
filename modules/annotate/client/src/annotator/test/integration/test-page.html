<h2>Vannevar Bush</h2>

<p>This has not been a scientist's war; it has been a war in which all have had a
part. The scientists, burying their old professional competition in the demand
of a common cause, have shared greatly and learned much. It has been
exhilarating to work in effective partnership. Now, for many, this appears to be
approaching an end. What are the scientists to do next?</p>

<p>For the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there can be
little indecision, for their war has hardly required them to leave the old
paths. Many indeed have been able to carry on their war research in their
familiar peacetime laboratories. Their objectives remain much the same.</p>

<p>It is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride, who have
left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive gadgets, who have
had to devise new methods for their unanticipated assignments. They have done
their part on the devices that made it possible to turn back the enemy, have
worked in combined effort with the physicists of our allies. They have felt
within themselves the stir of achievement. They have been part of a great team.
Now, as peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy of
their best.</p>
